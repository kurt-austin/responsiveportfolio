                    My name is Kurt Austin.  I am an IT consultant.  I am taking this course to expand my horizons and languages to broaden my overall experience and market myself to more clients.  Being an IT consultant, I do a lot of backend development work.  Because of that, I understand a lot of what Javascript is trying to accomplish.  Those same concepts can be applied to a lot of different languages.  What I am struggling a little is with the CSS/HTML portions.  I am not an artist or a designer by trade so layout of pages and so forth are a bit of a challenge for me.  When I do this in the real world, there are tools that do this for me automatically.
